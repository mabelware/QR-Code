# qr-code

This is my first challenge. I started learning HTML and CSS through a "bootcamp course" I bought on Udemy a year ago, but started using earlier this month. 

Here is what I did: 

1. Read instructions
2. Create local folder to hold project
3. Look at designs, read style guide
4. Create mockup with blocks on a sheet of lined paper. Mockup included: 
     -Body
     -Div for card
     -Image
     -H2
     -Paragraph
     THATS IT
 5. Create HTML and CSS page; set up HTML boilerplate etc. 
 6. Write HTML body to get all elements on the page
     -add some class names in (image class name; div class name)
 6. Create stylesheet and classes
 7. add all info from style guide (font, colours, etc.)
 8. Futz around with the image to make sure it showed up properly (adjusting image position)

I got pretty far in the process pretty quickly; then spent a lot of time making sure the padding and margins of the elements were "just so". So I probably spent just as much time playing around in chrome developer tools "eyeballing" padding and margins of the image, H2, paragraph, and "card" div (as I called it) as I spent putting the whole thing together. 

I'm pretty pleased with the result! I am still WAY TOO NEW to know if I used best practices or hacky terrible things to get the padding just right. But I'm sure I'll figure out "the right way" to do this as I keep learning!
